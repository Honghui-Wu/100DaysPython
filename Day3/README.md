# Treasure Island Project  

Your goal today is to build a "Chose your own adventure game". Using what you have learnt in the lessons today you will be building a very simple version of this type of text game.  

Use the flow chart linked below to create the game logic.

Once you've completed the project, you can always extend the game and make it more interesting!
